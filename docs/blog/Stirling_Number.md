# Stirling Number of the second kind

The number of ways to divide $$n$$ vertices into $$g$$ nonempty groups is given by the Stirling number of the second kind $$S_n^g$$, and hence the number of distinct community divisions is $$\sum_{g=1}^n S_n^g$$. This sum is not known in closed form, but we observe that $$S_n^1 +S_n^2 = 2^{n-1}$$ for all $$n>1$$.

Proof $$S_n^2 = 2^{n-1} -1$$
